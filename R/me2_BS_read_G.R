#' Get the G values from the BS results file (.txt)
#'
#' Files stored after a BS run are named with a user-specific prefix, shown 
#' here as an asterisk (*). Three output files (*_BS.dat,  *_BS.txt and 
#' *_BS.rsd) are stored after a BS run, and in this function the data provided 
#' in the \dQuote{.txt} file are read. The function \code{me2_BS_read_F}  
#' reads all the factor profiles in the text file and 
#' \code{me2_BS_read_G} (this function) reads all the factor contributions. 
#' Based on the provided \code{corr_threshold} in the \code{me2_BS_read_F} and
#' \code{me2_BS_read_G} functions only factors mapped to base factors with a 
#' correlation larger than \code{corr_threshold} are retained when aggregating 
#' the BS results (i.e., \dQuote{BS_P05}, \dQuote{BS_P95} and 
#' \dQuote{BS_median}). The residuals, stored in the *_BS.rsd file, can be 
#' read using \code{me2_read_residuals}.
#'
#' @param me2_bs_txt_file output file (.txt), containing the results and
#'  auxiliary information for the BS runs.
#' @param corr_threshold This parameter is used to filter out the factors that
#'   have a correlation less to the provided threshold (default = 0.6).
#'   This way only the BS results for factors with a correlation larger or 
#'   equal to the threshold are retained for the aggregated results. The
#'   threshold is also used in the mapping. When the maximum correlation for the
#'   BS factors is below the threshold, the factor is considered to be 
#'   "unmapped".
#' @param tidy_output Should the output be reshaped into tidy data? Default:
#'   FALSE
#' @param block_boundaries A list containing the \dQuote{start} and \dQuote{end}
#'   string used to identify the boundaries of the block containing the values
#'   for the G-matrix. The \dQuote{start_Gmap} and \dQuote{end_Gmap} are used to
#'   identify the boundaries of the block with the G correlations which
#'   are use to produce a mapping table (i.e., which factor has the highest
#'   correlation) that can be used to check swaps between factors.
#' @param dates A vector containing the sample dates for the rows in the
#'   G-matrix. If these dates are outputted in the ME-2 output as the
#'   second column (a column of row numbers being the first), then these values
#'   are used when \code{dates = NA}. The values inside the ME-2 output are
#'   overwritten when a vector of \code{dates} are provided.If this second
#'   column with dates is not available new daily dates, starting from
#'   1970-01-01 will be automatically provided.
#' @param factor_mass This is a vector with the same length as the number of
#'   factor profiles. It contains the total mass in concentration units which is
#'   used to transform the G matrix from unity to concentration units.
#' @param rescale_unity In some cases the averages of the G factors are not
#'   equal to unity. By default a warning is given whenever this is the case.
#'   With this parameter set to \code{TRUE} each factor is multiplied by
#'   1/avg(factor), so that the G factors are scaled to unity again.
#' @param tz Parameter to control the timezone when parameter \dQuote{dates} is
#'   not used. Default: 'Etc/GMT-1'#'
#'
#' @section Defining the block with data:
#'
#' The \dQuote{.txt} file contains a lot of empty lines, which are stripped
#' immediately after reading the file. This is important, as this ensures that
#' each block of data is contained withing two identifying strings.
#'
#' The function uses these lines to determine the start and end line in which
#' the data lies. As such, the lines between start and end are read and parsed.
#'
#' The identifying strings are provided using the \code{block_boundaries}, which
#' is a list containing the \dQuote{start} and \dQuote{end} string. The string
#' can be preceded by \code{^\\s*} which tells the function that the string can
#' begin with an undefined number of spaces.
#'
#' @section Adding dates to G:
#' By far the easiest way to add \dQuote{dates} to G is to provide them as
#' input parameters. The dates can probably be found in the original data
#' input used for ME-2 calculations. For multi time ME-2 application these dates
#' correspond with the lowest time resolution.
#'
#' @section Renaming factor profiles:
#' As the labels of the factor profiles are unknown, this routine reads them as
#' \dQuote{factor_xx}, with xx being a unique number and outputted as a
#' character array. The easiest way to work with this data is by re-coding this
#' vector as \code{factor}. Then the order of the factor profiles and the
#' correct names can be easily set using the following code.
#'
#' \preformatted{
#' mydata$factor <- factor(mydata$factor)
#' mydata$factor <- dplyr::recode_factor(mydata$factor,
#'                                       `factor_01` = "MyFirstName",
#'                                       `factor_02` = "MySecondName",
#'                                       ...
#' )
#' }
#'
#' Please note that the above will only work when the data is read with the
#' \code{tidy_output = TRUE} setting.
#'
#' @return \code{me2_BS_read_G} returns an object of class ``me2tools''.
#'   The object includes three main components: \code{call}, the command used
#'   to read the data; \code{data}, the G data for each BS run; \code{G_format},
#'   the tidied G data for each BS run where the correlation between the BASE 
#'   and BS factor is larger than the \dQuote{corr_threshold} and the 
#'   \code{G_mapping}, the mapping data based on G correlations of each BS run. 
#'   
#'   The output of the G-values for the BS results is nearly identical to the 
#'   output of the G-values from the base runs. The only difference is that the
#'   BS results have different values in the \dQuote{run_type} column. In this 
#'   case this column contains information of the type of bootstrap.
#'   
#'   The mapping data is constructed with the BASE factors in the columns and
#'   the row factors being the BS factors. Hence, by reading the rows one can
#'   observe swaps from BS factors into different BASE factors. Ideally, a
#'   BS factor should only be mapped to the same BASE factor. When the maximum 
#'   correlation for the BS factors is below the \dQuote{corr_threshold}, the 
#'   factor is considered to be "unmapped".
#'   
#'   If retained, e.g., using \code{output <- me2_BSDISP_read_res(file)}, this 
#'   output can be used to recover the data, reproduce, or undertake further 
#'   analysis.
#'
#'   An me2tools output can be manipulated using a number of generic operations,
#'   including \code{print}, \code{plot} and \code{summary}.
