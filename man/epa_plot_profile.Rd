\arguments{
\item{F_matrix}{Tibble from \code{\link[pmfr]{me2_read_F}} containing
the results for the F_matrix. In order to use this function only the
results from a single run should be provided.}

\item{xlabel.angle}{What angle should the x-axis labels be presented in? If
your labels are long, \code{45} degrees can be useful, which is also the
default.}

\item{xlabel.vjust}{vertical justification of the xlabel, between [0,1].
The default is NA, so that ggplot uses some heuristics to pick the best
value for this parameter. Any other value is processed by changing theme
settings,}

\item{xlabel.hjust}{horizontal justification of the xlabel, between [0,1].
The default is NA, so that ggplot uses some heuristics to pick the best
value for this parameter. Any other value is processed by changing theme
settings,}

\item{xlabel.order}{The labels containing the species on the x-axis are
plotted based on the factor levels. This parameter can contain the levels
and the species are transformed to factors using these levels. N.B. these
levels can contain code for expressions.}

\item{xlabel.top.bottom}{Boolean used for splitting the xlabels into a top
and bottom section. The odd indices of the labels will presented at the top
using a secondary axis, whereas the even indices of the labels are
presented at the bottom. This works especially well with plots containing
a lot of species. Instead of using a small font size, the labels are
distributed to the top and bottom. Default setting is \code{FALSE}}

\item{y_min}{The minimum value for the y-axis, which is used to cut-off the
logarithmic scale. The default setting is \code{-5}, which corresponds to
1xE-5.}

\item{ylab}{Primary y-axis label.}

\item{ylab2}{Secondary y-axis label.}

\item{xlab}{x-axis label.}

\item{auto.text}{Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If
\code{TRUE} attempts will be made to automatically format titles,
axis labels, pollutant names and units properly, e.g., by subscripting
the \sQuote{2} in NO2.}

\item{x.font.size}{The size of the xtick labels. Defaults to 10.}

\item{x.n.dodge}{The number of rows on the x-axis that should be used to
render the labels. Useful for labels that otherwise overlap, for example
with a large number of species. Also allows for a larger
\sQuote{x.font.size}.}

\item{bar.color}{Provide the fill color for the concentration based bars on
the logarithmic scale. Is set to \sQuote{steelblue}, as an approximation of
the color used in EPA-PMF program.}

\item{bar.width}{The width of the bar, expressed as a value between [0,1].}

\item{point.color}{The fill color for the explained variation, with the
default being \sQuote{red}, similar to the color used in the EPA-PMF
program.}

\item{point.size}{The size of the point of the explained variation,
defaults to 3.}

\item{point.shape}{The shape of the point of the explained variation. The
default is 19 (circle). Using 15 will produce a square.}

\item{lollipops}{Should the dot representing the EV be extended with a line,
representing so it looks more like a lollipop? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{errorbar}{If the F_matrix contains the results of the error estimates,
the error bars for one of those estimates can be plotted in this plot.
Valid options are \sQuote{none} (default), \sQuote{DISP}, \sQuote{BS} or
\sQuote{BSDISP}.}

\item{errorbar.color}{The color used for plotting the error bars for
DISP.}

\item{errorbar.width}{The width of the upper and lower bars for displaying
the error estimate. Defaults to 0.45 (i.e., the bar.width / 2)}

\item{errorbar.size}{The line size of the errorbars. Defaults to 1.}

\item{errorbar.point.size}{The size of the point used to display the
average/median error estimates when \code{cp.run.type} is set as
\sQuote{base_run}.}

\item{show.plot}{A logical argument evaluating to TRUE or FALSE indicating
whether the plot should be shown as default.}

\item{expand.mult}{Vector of multiplicative range expansion factors used on
the x-axis . Defaults to \code{c(0.015,0.005)}, as this seems to work best.
If length is 1, then both left and right x-axis are multiplied with this
factor. If length is 2, the left limit is expanded by \code{expand.mult[1]}
and the right by \code{expand.mult[2]}.}

\item{rm.grid.x}{Should the vertical grid lines be removed? In some cases
there are a lot of species, causing the vertical grid lines to clutter the
plot. If set to \code{TRUE} these lines are removed. Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{perc.x.interval}{The interval used for the x.ticks on the secondary
axis. The default is 20, leading to intervals of
\dQuote{c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100)}. The value 25 leads to
\dQuote{c(0, 25, 50, 75, 100)}.}

\item{cp.run.type}{The concentration and percentage of species are typically
plotted using the \sQuote{base_run} values (default). However, by changing
this variable to \sQuote{DISP_avg}, \sQuote{BS_median} or
\sQuote{BSDISP_avg}, these values (if available) are plotted.}

\item{...}{Other parameters, for example renamed parameters.}

\description{
Function to plot PMF factor profiles using data from PMFR (using
\code{\link[pmfr]{read_pmf_factor_profiles}} and
\code{\link[pmfr]{tidy_pmf_profiles}}) or from the ME2tools package using
\code{\link{me2_read_F}} in the same way as in EPA-PMF.

\section{Input format of the F-matrix}{


The format of the F-matrix as a tibble consists of seven columns. These
seven columns are
\itemize{
\item \code{model_type}: a descriptive column with the name of the model
used to calculate the results (e.g., \dQuote{ME-2} or \dQuote{EPA-PMF})
\item \code{factor_profile}: consists of at least two different
profiles: \dQuote{concentration_of_species} and
\dQuote{percentage_of_species_sum}. The concentration profile is in
concentration units, whereas the percentage is in percentages [0,100].
\item \code{model_run}: integer to denote the model run, for example used
when reading the results of multiple run. When processing only the
\dQuote{base_run} from RPA-PMF this column can be set to 1.
\item \code{species}: the name of the species
\item \code{run_type}: consists of different types of runs. There should
be at least one set of data with different \code{factor_profiles} for
\code{run_type = "base_run"}. Other options for run_type are
\dQuote{DISP_min}, \dQuote{DISP_avg} and \dQuote{DISP_max} for DISP
results. For BS results the options are \dQuote{BS_P05},
\dQuote{BS_median} and \dQuote{BS_P95}, and for BSDISP results options
\dQuote{"BSDISP_P05}, \dQuote{BSDISP_avg} and \dQuote{BSDISP_P95} can
be used.
\item \code{factor}: the names of the resolved factors.
\item \code{value} : the values, either in concentration units or
percentages.
}

A typical plot of the F-matrix shows the concentration of each species on a
log scale (bars), and the percentage of species sum in a percentage scale
(points). By default, the values associated with both \code{factor_profiles}
\dQuote{concentration_of_species} and \dQuote{percentage_of_species_sum} for
the \code{run_type} \dQuote{base_run} is used.
}

\section{Plotting of errorbars}{


The function is capable of plotting errorbars for the results of either DISP,
BS or BSDISP. Only one set of results is supported at this point. To use
this feature, \code{errorbar} should be set to one of the options
\dQuote{DISP}, \dQuote{BS} or \dQuote{BSDISP} (default is \dQuote{none}).
Based on the selection the function automatically checks for and uses the
provided data.

When using \code{cp.run.type = "base_run"}, meaning that the concentration
bars and the percentage dots are plotted using the values associated with
the base_run, plotting the error bars only require the run_type of
\dQuote{DISP_min} and \dQuote{DISP_max} for DISP; the \dQuote{BS_P05} and
\dQuote{BS_P95} for BS and \dQuote{BSDISP_P05} and \dQuote{BSDISP_P95} for
BSDISP, respectively. The average/median of the error estimates is plotted
using \dQuote{DISP_avg}, \dQuote{BS_median}, or \dQuote{BSDISP_avg} and
displayed as a point within the error bars when
\code{cp.run.type = "base_run"}. The selected \code{run_type} should at least
be available in concentration units (i.e.,
\code{factor_profile = "concentration_of_species"}).

The concentration bars and percentage dots can also be plotted based on the
average/median of the error estimates. In that case it is important that for
each average/median of the error estimates also the percentages of the sum
of the species (i.e., \code{factor_profile = "percentage_of_species_sum"})
is present in the F-matrix.
